Esp CAR Control System
This Arduino sketch enables control of a Esp CAR equipped with various motors via a web interface. The system is built on an ESP32 microcontroller, allowing for wireless control over a local Wi-Fi network.

Features
Control of multiple motors for movement and other functions.
Real-time control via a web interface served by the ESP32.
WebSocket communication for low-latency interaction.
Humidity display for environmental monitoring.
Responsive design for seamless usage across devices.
Setup
Hardware Requirements:

ESP32 microcontroller board.
Motors and associated driver circuitry as per the defined pin configuration.
Stable power supply for the ESP32 and motors.
Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support.
Required libraries: WiFi.h, AsyncTCP.h, ESPAsyncWebServer.h.
Connections:

Connect motors according to the pin configuration specified in the code.
Wi-Fi Configuration:

Update the ssid and password variables in the code with your Wi-Fi credentials.
Upload the Sketch:

Open the Arduino IDE, load the sketch, and upload it to your ESP32 board.
Accessing the Interface:

Once connected to the same Wi-Fi network, open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of the ESP32.
Usage
Web Interface:

Upon accessing the ESP32's IP address, a web interface will be displayed with control buttons for motor movement.
Use the provided buttons to control the Agro Spiderbot's movement and other functions.
WebSocket Communication:

WebSocket protocol is used for real-time communication between the web interface and the microcontroller.
WebSocket events allow for immediate feedback and control over the connected devices.
